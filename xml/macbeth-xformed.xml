<line>Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,</line>

<line>Is this a dagger which I see before me,</line>
<line>The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.</line>
<line>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</line>
<line>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</line>
<line>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but</line>
<line>A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</line>
<line>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</line>
<line>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</line>

<line>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</line>
<line>Which was not so before. There's no such thing:</line>
<line>It is the bloody business which informs</line>

<line>Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,</line>

<line>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</line>

<line>Things have been strangely borne. The</line>

<line>Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</line>
<line>And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</line>
<line>Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</line>
<line>For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</line>
<line>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</line>
<line>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</line>
<line>To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</line>
<line>How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight</line>
<line>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</line>
<line>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</line>
<line>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</line>
<line>For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</line>

<line>He has borne all things well: and I do think</line>
