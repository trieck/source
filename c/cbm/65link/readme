CBM 6502 Linker
Copyright(c) 1999-2001 Thomas A. Rieck
Version 0.0.1
Concept:
Linker application that takes as it's input 1 or more
object files generated by the Teeny Tiny 6502 Assembler (t6502),
and produces as it's output a single binary image that can
be directly loaded under the c64 or emulated nptune64 program.
Ideas:
-> t6502 should generate .o object files
-> t6502 should support the extern keyword
-> t6502 should support one and only one routine declared global with [ORIGIN]
-> should the linker support differe nt sections for code and data?
-> linker should error if no globals, or more than one global defined
-> what is the layout of object files???
-> most changes are in t6502
Object File Layout:
*****************************************************************************
['C']['B']['M'][Minor Version #][Major Version #]
*****************************************************************************
should the linker be responsible
for the ORIGIN definition or 
should that be able to be set in the
module during assembly time
I like the idea that the linker would handle it
