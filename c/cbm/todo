						Neptune64 Emulator TODO List
									1/2001
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 	it should NOT be possible to assemble code at ROM locations.  
	More specifically code should not be able to be written to these locations
	This should some how be handled internally by the emulator.  I think we have the 
	wrong concept / idea here.
	
	[done]
	
* 	support undocumented opcodes.
* 	create subdirectories for win32, bcc for t6502, td6502 
	and remove Makefile.win32
	
	[done]
	
* 	6502 emulation should be decoupled from the C64 issues, ie, kernal, basic ROM, etc.
	[done]
	
* 	readline needs to work for Unix.
* 	set up memory management module.  we really cannot proceed without this
	[done]
* 	make common a library
	[done]
	
* 	it is time for interrupts!
* 	change go operation in monitor to do a pc->push
