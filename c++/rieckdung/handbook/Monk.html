<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Monks are a most unusual class; they
tend to be reserved, introspective</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">characters whose motivation and direction
are seldom clear (or even vaguely</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">understood) by others. A monk must have
a minimum of 15 in wisdom,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">dexterity, and strength and a minimum
of 11 constitution. Monks never gain</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">experience point bonuses.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Monks are monastic aesthetics who practice
rigorous mental and physical</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">training and discipline. All monks must
be lawful in alignment. Any monk</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">that loses his lawful alignment loses
all monk abilities and must begin</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">again as a 1st-level character.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Monks use the same combat table as thieves.
However, due to their extensive</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">study of weaponry, monks add &frac12;
point per level of experience to any</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">damage done with a weapon. The special
attack form of the monk, though, is</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">his dedication to a martial art. Monks
receive the Martial Arts nonweapon</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">proficiency free at 1st level. The exact
style is dictated by the favored</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">style of the monk character's order.
They also start with two of the style's</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">special maneuvers. In addition to the
normal special maneuvers of the monk's</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">style, all monks initially posses the
special maneuver missile deflection.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">An additional nonweapon proficiency slot
in Martial Arts is gained at 6th</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">and 13th levels. These slots also must
be spent in the style favored by the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">monk's order. The Monk Ability Table
shows the additional number of attacks</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">and damage that a monk does in his favored
martial art. The fraction under</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Additional attacks is the number of extra
attacks per round that the monk</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">may make with his style. Thus, 1/4 indicates
1 additional attack every 4</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">rounds. Likewise, the Additional Damage
column shows the number of dice</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">and/or hit points of damage done. Extra
dice of damage are of the same type</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">the style normally uses; thus, +1D +1
for a style that usually does D6</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">damage means 2-7 more hit points of damage
on each attack.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">In addition to damage, monks attacking
with martial arts have a increased</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">chance to stun, or even kill, an opponent.
If the monk's to hit roll exceeds</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">by 5 or more the minimum number necessary
to hit an opponent, the creature</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">is stunned for 1-6 rounds. The chance
to kill is equal to the opponent's</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">armor class added to the number of levels
the monk is above 7th. Note that</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">in order to kill, 1) the monk must score
a hit, 2) the hit must stun, and 3)</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">the percentage or lower must be rolled.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Likewise, monks save as thieves, but with
certain advantages: if a monk</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">makes his or her saving throw against
an attack, no damage is sustained. At</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">9th level and above, if a monk fails
his save, then only half damage is</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">sustained (if possible). Note that a
failed save against fireball would do</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">only &frac12; damage, but failing a save
vs. a basilisk would still petrify</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">the monk.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">At 1st level, monks are 30% likely to
be surprised (q.v.). For each level</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">thereafter, reduce this by 2%, subject
to a minimum of 2% at 15th level and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">beyond.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Monks have the following thieves' abilities.
Monks receive the same initial</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">scores as thieves, but receive only 20
points per level thereafter.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* Open Locks</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* Find / Remove Traps</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* Move Silently</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* Hide in Shadows</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* Hear Noise</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* Climb Walls</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Monks have normal dexterity modifiers
to these abilities.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Although the chance of falling while climbing
walls is the same as a thief</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">of equal level, a monk can escape damage
as follows:</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* At 4th level, a monk can fall up to
20$'$ if within 1$'$ of a wall.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* At 6th level, a monk can fall up to
30$'$ if within 4$'$ of a wall.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* At 9th level, a monk can fall up to
40$'$ if within 6$'$ of a wall.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">* At 13th level, a monk can fall any
distance if within 8$'$ of a wall.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The monk must have the opportunity to
periodically make contact with the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">wall to slow the fall.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">There are a number of strictures that
monks must abide by:</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">1. All treasure not required for personal
upkeep and maintenance of a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">stronghold must be give away, as per
paladins (q.v.).</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">2. Magic items usable include weapons
of permitted types, rings, and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">miscellaneous magic items usable by thieves.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">3. No bonuses to hit or to damage due
to high strength.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">4. High dexterity affords no armor class
bonus.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">5. Until attaining 6th level (Master),
monks may have no hirelings or</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">henchmen. At 6th level, monks may hire
for short-term duration only,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">and may acquire up to 2 henchmen. Henchmen
may be fighters (not</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">barbarians or rangers though), thieves,
or assassins. With each level</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">above 6th, the monk may hire one additional
henchmen, until the maximum</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">allowable by his or her charisma is reached.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">6. There can be only a limited number
of monks above 7th level within a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">given order. There are three 8th level
monks, and but one of each</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">higher level. In order to gain a level,
monks must best the current</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">holder in combat (without weapons or
magic items) in a manner similar</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">to druids (q.v.).</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes there is a vacancy in the hierarchy
of the order to which the monk</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">belongs; in this case, the monk will
not be required to fight for</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">advancement. This is rare, however. The
monk may change his allegiance to a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">different order at any time prior to
attaining 8th level; in doing so, he</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">immediately drops to the minimum number
of points needed to attain his or</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">her current level. Should a monk of 8th
level or higher wish to change</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">orders, he must find an order with a
vacancy at the level one below his</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">current level. The character may change
orders by assuming this position,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">reducing his experience points to the
minimum necessary to attain the next</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">lower level. Once a monk has left an
order, he may never return to it, and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">all reactions with members of such an
order are at -4. Only monks of 17th</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">level (Grand Master of Flowers) may start
their own order.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Upon reaching 8th level, the monk will
gain a number of followers upon</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">defeating the monk which held the position
previously. He or she will</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">attract 2-5 1st-level monks if the player
character has built a monastery or</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">similar structure. The character will
attract 1-2 additional 1st level</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">followers for each level gained thereafter.
These followers may be worked</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">upwards in level. While they are loyal
and require no support, upkeep, or</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">pay, they will leave as soon as attaining
7th level (Superior Master). Note</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">that a monk may only build a monastery
after attaining 8th level.</FONT></B>

&nbsp;<B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Notes regarding Special Abilities:</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">A. The ability to speak with animals as
the druid spell.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">B. The ability to mask the mind so that
ESP has only a 30% chance of</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">success. For each level above the 4th,
the chance for successfully</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">ESPing a monk drops by 2%.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">C. The monk is immune to all diseases,
and slow or haste spells.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">D. The ability to use a self-induced
catalepsy to appear dead. This can be</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">done perfectly, as the monk is able to
lower his or her body</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">temperature and heart rate. The monk
is able to maintain this state for</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">a number of turns equal to twice his
level.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">E. The ability to heal damage on the
monk's body. Total damage healed is</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">2-5 hit points, plus one point per level
above the 7th.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">F. The ability to speak with plants as
the druid spell.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">G. Beguiling, charms, hypnosis, and suggestion
spells have only a 50%</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">chance of affecting a monk; this resistance
is increased by 5% per</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">level thereafter.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">H. Telepathic and mind blast attacks
upon a monk of 10th level or higher</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">mare made as if the monk had an intelligence
of 18, due to the monk's</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">mental discipline.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">I. Immunity to poisons of all types.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">J. Immunity to geas and quest spells.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">K. The last ability gained, and perhaps
the most fearsome power, is that</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">fabled attack which enables the monk
to set up vibrations in the body</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">of a victim, and the monk can control
the vibrations so as to cause</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">death to occur when the monk stops them.
Known as the "quivering palm,"</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">the monk merely touches his victim to
set up the deadly vibrations. The</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">victim can be virtually any creature.
This power is subject to the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">following limitations:</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">1. It can be attempted but once per week,
and the monk must touch the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">intended victim within 3 rounds or the
power is drained for one</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">week.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">2. It has no effect on undead or creatures
which can only be hit by</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">magic weapons.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">3. The victim can have no more hit dice
than the monk, and its total</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">hit points cannot be more than twice
the monk's.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">4. The command to die (control of the
vibrations) must be given</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">within one day per level of experience
of the monk, or the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">vibrations will cease of their own accord
and do no damage</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">whatsoever.</FONT></B>
