The cleric class is primarily concerned with the worship of a specific<BR>
deity, and the spread of this deity's worship to others. Wielding the<BR>
powerful magics that a deity grants requires good judgment and knowledge;<BR>
thus, the principle attribute of a cleric is wisdom. A cleric must have a<BR>
minimum score of 9 in wisdom; a good dexterity, constitution, and strength<BR>
are also desirable. Clerics with a wisdom of 16 or greater gain a 10%<BR>
experience bonus; they also gain bonus spells (see Wisdom Table II).<BR>
<BR>
Clerics are permitted to wear any sort of armor, but they may not use edged<BR>
weapons, as bloodshed is forbidden to clerics. Certain types of clerics<BR>
(particularly those found in Oriental settings (Shukenja) and those who<BR>
worship more non-violent deities) may futher restrict the choice of armor<BR>
and weapons from those normally allowed to clerics. Various religious orders<BR>
may also have preferred and/or forbidden weapons. Clerics have good combat<BR>
and saving throw possibilities and also may cast a wide variety of magic<BR>
spells.<BR>
<BR>
Since most deities are influential in and/or are only concerned with a few<BR>
areas, clerics often have restrictions on the types of spells that they may<BR>
cast. Deities tend to grant spells only from the spheres in which they have<BR>
interest in, and those which may be in general accordance with the deity's<BR>
philosophy. See below for more details on spheres of influence.<BR>
<BR>
Clerics have the ability to turn or compel into service most undead and some<BR>
minor demons and devils.<BR>
<BR>
When a cleric reaches 10th level, construction of magic items, scrolls, and<BR>
potions is possible. This tends to be a time-consuming and costly process,<BR>
so most clerics seldom make more than a few items in their careers. However,<BR>
it is possible to create vast and powerful magics as legends speak of,<BR>
albeit with lots of money, a great deal of time, and not a little luck!<BR>
<BR>
Upon reaching 9th level, clerics may build a religious stronghold. This must<BR>
contain a temple, et al., of at least 2500 square feet. This stronghold will<BR>
attract a body of loyal worshipers (troops) that will serve for nothing more<BR>
than food and lodging. After clearing an area around the temple, the cleric<BR>
may collect revenues of 9sp per inhabitant from all the inhabitants.<BR>
<BR>
Spheres of Influence<BR>
<BR>
The deity which the cleric worships is usually part of a parthenon; that is,<BR>
a group of gods and/or goddesses, each of whom has some area of<BR>
responsibilities within the greater group. The areas which the cleric's<BR>
deity are concerned are called it spheres of influence. Within their<BR>
specific field, most deities are supreme, even able to counter the actions<BR>
of much more powerful (overall) members of the parthenon. A classic example<BR>
is Demeter, the goddess of the harvest in greek mythology. Even Zeus, chief<BR>
among gods, was powerless to halt her effects - in this case, the onset of<BR>
winter - when Hades kidnapped her daughter, Persephone.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, clerics of a god or goddess tend to share that deity's concern for<BR>
specific areas. They tend to consider their deity's sphere(s) of influence<BR>
the most important matter; all other concerns are secondary.<BR>
<BR>
Due to most deities' concentration in specific areas, almost all deities are<BR>
limited in the scope of spells that they may grant to their followers.<BR>
Deities may grant spells within their spheres of influence and those which<BR>
are closely related or which usually help their clerics attain the deities'<BR>
goals. Thus, a goddess concerned with the protection of the home would most<BR>
likely grant spells from the spheres of guarding, wards, and healing. In<BR>
this case, healing would probably be granted since it fits within the<BR>
goddess' philosophy of protection. The DM has specific information on the<BR>
spheres of influence of each deity in your campaign.<BR>
<BR>
The spheres given by the DM for each deity are those in which the cleric may<BR>
routinely ask for spells. In unusual circumstances, the cleric may ask for<BR>
spells from other spheres, but the granting of these spells is subject to<BR>
examination by the deity. Some spells may never be granted by a deity, as<BR>
they are completely beyond that deity's influence and/or are inimical to the<BR>
deity's purpose. Asking for such spells will often bring disfavor to the<BR>
cleric, as he or she should have know better than to ask!<BR>
<BR>
Monotheistic religious are not always so limited, but often in these cases,<BR>
the deity is loath to grant spells from certain areas, as they do not fit<BR>
within the deity's philosophy. Consult the DM for information on<BR>
monotheistic religions in your campaign.<BR>

Quest Spells<BR>
<BR>
Quest spells are the means by which deities enable their servants (i.e.<BR>
clerics) to perform mighty acts in their name. Quest spells (not to be<BR>
confused with the 5th-level spell quest) do not have a level - instead, they<BR>
are a direct grant of a portion of the deity's power to the cleric. Quest<BR>
spells usually affect a large area or number of creatures, last for a much<BR>
longer period of time than normal spells, and are either extremely hard or<BR>
impossible to dispel or counter, short of another Quest spell.<BR>
<BR>
The restrictions and circumstances regarding the gaining and use of Quest<BR>
magic is covered in the part on Campaigns under the Chapter on magic. Refer<BR>
to this chapter for more details on Quest magic.<BR>
<BR>
Faith Magic<BR>
<BR>
A unique aspect of clerical magic is faith magic. This type of magic draws<BR>
on the devotional energies of a group of followers to greatly enhance the<BR>
effects of clerical magic. Magic-users cannot harness energies in this way;<BR>
a group of mages casting in concert gain no special bonus, while a group of<BR>
clerics is able to combine and magnify their efforts. Range, duration, area<BR>
of effect, and even damage may be altered by use of faith magic.<BR>
<BR>
The core support for faith magic is devotional power. Devotional energy<BR>
comes from the dedicated belief of people, whether a character class or<BR>
normal persons is irrelevant, only the strength of their belief is<BR>
important.<BR>
<BR>
Before devotional power can be harnessed in faith magic, the group of<BR>
dedicated followers must be gathered in the immediate area and concentrated<BR>
in their actions. This is known as focusing the effect. Clerics use the<BR>
spell focus to create the necessary channel to direct the devotional energy.<BR>
<BR>
Once the focus has been created, the clerics may cast the spells to be<BR>
enhanced. The exact effects depend on the amount of devotional energy<BR>
available, and the level of the cleric casting the spell. See the 4th-level<BR>
spell focus for a more detailed list of spells that may benefit from faith<BR>
magic and the enhancing effect these spells gain.<BR>
<BR>
Note that due to the nature of devotional energy, all persons participating<BR>
in the faith magic must worship the same deity.<BR>
<BR>
Cooperative Magic<BR>
<BR>
Cooperative magic is similar to, but not exactly like, faith magic. Rather<BR>
than draw upon the devotional energy of a group of worshippers, cooperative<BR>
magic allows several clerics to combine their abilities to create a greater<BR>
effect.<BR>
<BR>
Cooperative magics do not require a focus or devotional energy; all that is<BR>
required is several clerics that are of sufficient level to cast the<BR>
cooperative spell in question. Note that only one must actually possess the<BR>
spell and cast it; the others only must be of sufficient level to be able to<BR>
cast (and thus understand) it.<BR>
<BR>
Clerics involved in cooperative magic are usually of the same religion,<BR>
though it is possible for clerics of deities which work in close harmony to<BR>
cast cooperative magic together.<BR>
