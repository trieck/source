The istari class is perhaps the single-most powerful profession. The secrets<BR>
of becoming an istari are known only to a few ancient, highly advanced, and<BR>
magical nations who, through long association with divine, mystic, and<BR>
magical powers, have been able to combine the best of the fighter and<BR>
magic-user classes (q.v.). Only humans from these rare states with the<BR>
proper status may become istari. Due to the rigors of training, only lawful<BR>
characters may become istari. Istari must have minimum ability scores of 15<BR>
in intelligence and strength, and 12 in wisdom and constitution. Note that<BR>
they are entitled to the extra bonus due to high constitution that fighters<BR>
are allowed, but may not (at least initially) roll for Exceptional Strength.<BR>
Istari gain no experience point bonus for their high ability scores.<BR>
<BR>
Istari use magic-user spells as a magic-user of equivalent level, but may<BR>
not become specialists. However, they do gain a special bonus: an additional<BR>
number of spell levels equal to the istari's current level may be memorized.<BR>
Thus, a 5th-level istari gains 5 bonus spell levels, which may be taken as 5<BR>
1st-level spells, three 1st and a 2nd, a 2nd and a 3rd, etc. This ability is<BR>
similar to the bonus spells gained by the Grand Druid (q.v.). Istari use the<BR>
same spell table as do magic-users.<BR>
<BR>
When engaging in combat, istari behave as fighters of an identical level.<BR>
They have all the weapon choices of the standard fighter class, including<BR>
specialization (q.v.). However, istari may only ever specialize in one<BR>
weapon. Istari prefer one-handed weapons, which allow them to spell-cast<BR>
easily. Due to the demands of spellcasting, they are unable to wear armor<BR>
heavier than chainmail, and may not use a shield. The special nature of the<BR>
istari allows spell casting while armor-clad, similar to elven<BR>
fighter/magic-users.<BR>
<BR>
Istari use either the magic-user or fighter saving throw matrix, whichever<BR>
is more beneficial. Due to their specialized training and magical<BR>
background, all istari save vs. spells, rods, staves, wands, and other forms<BR>
of magic at +1 per four levels of experience (ie. +1 at levels 1-4, +2 at<BR>
levels 5-8, etc.) They are able to use all magic items allowable to both the<BR>
fighter and magic-user classes, and magic arms and weapons of their<BR>
permitted types.<BR>
<BR>
Starting at 12th level, istari are capable of constructing magic items in<BR>
the same manner as normal magic-users.<BR>
<BR>
Istari never gain followers as a normal fighter does, and few build castles.<BR>
Henchmen are gained in the normal way, though no chaotic henchmen may ever<BR>
be employed by an istari.<BR>
