Assassin is a subclass of thief whose primary concern is killing for profit.<BR>
Assassins must be smart and strong in addition to quick and quite if they<BR>
hope to live long. Assassins must have the following minimum ability scores:<BR>
12 in dexterity and strength, and 11 in intelligence. Assassins never gain<BR>
experience bonuses.<BR>
<BR>
Assassins are all of evil alignment,as the taking of life for profit is not<BR>
considered a good act. They may be of lawful, neutral, or chaotic<BR>
persuasions, though.<BR>
<BR>
Assassins fight and save as thieves. However, they benefit from being able<BR>
to use shields and may wield any sort of weapon. They are also able to<BR>
attack with intent to assassinate.<BR>
<BR>
The primary abilities of an assassin are:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Use of any poison.<BR>
  2. If a victim is surprised (q.v.), an assassin may opt to attack on the<BR>
     assassination table, which greatly increases the chance for<BR>
     instantaneous death. Should the assassination attempt fail, weapon<BR>
     damage accrues normally.<BR>
  3. Assassins with 15 or higher intelligence are able to learn an alignment<BR>
     tongue or special language such as that of druids or thieves. This<BR>
     ability is gained at 9th level and one additional language may be<BR>
     learned for each level attained thereafter, subject to a maximum of one<BR>
     language per point of intelligence over 14.<BR>
  4. The assassin may disguise himself as per the nonweapon proficiency<BR>
     (q.v.). At every odd level beyond the first (i.e. 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc),<BR>
     a -1 bonus is gained.<BR>
  5. The ability to spy. See the DM for more details on spying missions.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, assassins possess the thief functions backstab, pick pockets,<BR>
open locks, find/remove traps, move silently, hide in shadows, detect noise,<BR>
and climb walls. Backstabbing is done at as if the assassin were the same<BR>
level thief. Assassins begin with the following scores in their thief<BR>
abilities:<BR>
<BR>
 Ability          Base Maximum<BR>
 Pick Pockets       5    none<BR>
 Open Locks        10    none<BR>
 Find/Remove Traps  5    none<BR>
 Move Silently     10    100<BR>
 Hide in Shadows   10    100<BR>
 Detect Noise      10     60<BR>
 Climb Walls       55    100<BR>
<BR>
25 additional points are allotted for distribution at 1st level; an<BR>
additional 25 points is gained for every level attained thereafter. The<BR>
effects of wearing armor other than simple leather is the same as for<BR>
thieves; see the table Effects of Armor on Thief Functions under Thief<BR>
(q.v.).<BR>
<BR>
The abilty to read languages is gained as per a regualr thief, but the<BR>
ability to cast spells from scrolls is not gained until 12th level.<BR>
<BR>
An assassin character cannot have any henchmen until 4th level is attained,<BR>
at which time lower level assassins may be hired. Upon attaining 8th level,<BR>
thieves may be included among the character's henchmen. Upon attaining 12th<BR>
level, any class of character may be hired.<BR>
<BR>
In order for an assassin character to gain experience levels above 13th, he<BR>
or she must challenge the local Guildmaster of Assassins (14th) to a duel.<BR>
Likewise, in order to attain 15th level, a character must find and challenge<BR>
a Grandfather of Assassins (15th) to a duel. Note that assassins consider<BR>
duplicity, treachery, trickery, ambush, etc. as fair, so a higher level<BR>
character can accept a challenge, then have the challenger slain by archers,<BR>
for example.<BR>
<BR>
As a Guildmaster of Assassins, a character will have a body of guild members<BR>
numbering 7-28. Upon a change of leadership, it is 75% likely that each<BR>
current guild member will leave. Thus, it will be necessary for the new<BR>
Guildmaster to let in new assassins. They will all be 1st level, and must be<BR>
worked upwards. The maximum number of such followers will be determined by<BR>
the DM. These are in addition to henchmen, of course. Note that guild<BR>
members are only loyal to power, strength, and profit.<BR>
<BR>
The headquarters of a guild is always in a large town or city. It is a<BR>
nondescript, undistinguished-looking building. All expenses of the guild and<BR>
its members - excluding the Guildmaster - are assumed to be fully paid for<BR>
by normal guild activities. Any improvements, changes, the expenses of the<BR>
leader, and all other special costs must be borne by the Guildmaster.<BR>
<BR>
The headquarters of a Grandfather of Assassins can be virtually anywhere in<BR>
any form. However, if it is in an obvious form, it must be well away from<BR>
all communities. Upon attaining leadership of all assassins, the new<BR>
Grandfather must pay all remaining assassins 1,000 gold pieces for each of<BR>
their levels of experience, completely destroy the old headquarters, and<BR>
build a new one someplace else.<BR>
