The principle attribute of a fighter is Strength. To become a fighter, a<BR>
character must have a minimum Strength of 9 and a Constitution of 7 or<BR>
greater. A good Dexterity score is also desirable. If a fighter has a<BR>
Strength of 16 or greater, a bonus of an additional 10% is added to his<BR>
experience points gained. Also, a high Strength gives the fighter a better<BR>
chance to hit an opponent an causes an increased amount of damage.<BR>
<BR>
Fighters excel in combat; they have the best choice of arms and armor of all<BR>
classes, and have excellent hit points. Also, they have the best combat<BR>
table and have good saving throws as well.<BR>
<BR>
As they gain levels, fighters increase the number of attacks per round that<BR>
they may make. Also, fighters are able to take advantage of weapon<BR>
specialization (q.v.).<BR>
<BR>
Fighters may use any form of magic armor and weaponry they find; in<BR>
addition, they may use certain types of wands and rods, ``protection''<BR>
scrolls, most rings, all potions, and may miscellaneous magic items.<BR>
<BR>
Upon attaining 9th level, a fighter may settle down and establish a<BR>
freehold. This is done by building some sort of castle and clearing the<BR>
surrounding are - making it free of hostile creatures - for a radius of<BR>
20-50 miles around the stronghold. After this is done, the fighter will<BR>
attract a group of men-at-arms as followers; they must be quartered and paid<BR>
as usual. The fighter is entitled to collect a revenue of 7sp per inhabitant<BR>
living within his domain.<BR>
