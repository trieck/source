The profession of thief is not dishonorable, albeit not highly respectable<BR>
in some quarters. The major ability of a thief is dexterity, and a character<BR>
must have a minimum of 9 to become a thief. High intelligence is also<BR>
desirable. Any thief with a dexterity greater than 15 gains a +10%<BR>
experience point bonus. High dexterity also gives bonuses to the chance to<BR>
perform certain thief functions (see Dexterity Table II).<BR>
<BR>
All thieves are neutral or evil in alignment, though they may rarely be<BR>
neutral good. Most thieves tend toward evil.<BR>
<BR>
Thieves are primarily meant to take by cunning and stealth. They are allowed<BR>
to wear light armor and use a fairly wide variety of weapons. Though they<BR>
fight only slightly better than magic-users, they are able to backstab with<BR>
great effectiveness.<BR>
<BR>
The primary functions of a thief are:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Pick Pockets - this includes such activities as flinching and pilfering<BR>
     small items. It is modified downward by -5% for each level of the<BR>
     victim over 3rd. Thus, a 10th level victim reduces the chance of<BR>
     success by -35%. If the roll fails by 21% or more, the victim notices<BR>
     the attempt, with possible consequences to the thief. Success gains an<BR>
     item from the victim; up to two attempts per round may be made.<BR>
  2. Opening Locks - this includes figuring out how to open sliding puzzle<BR>
     locks and foiling magical closures. This usually requires a special set<BR>
     of tools to accomplish. It may be attempted by any thief but once per<BR>
     lock. If the thief fails, no further attempts to open the lock will<BR>
     succeed until the thief has gained a level, at which time a new roll<BR>
     may be made. Locks take from 1-10 rounds to open, depending upon<BR>
     complexity.<BR>
  3. Finding/Removing Traps - this pertains to relatively small mechanical<BR>
     devices. Finding and removing are two separate activities. Only one try<BR>
     per thief is allowed. Particularly ingenious and/or difficult to reach<BR>
     traps may modify the chance of success. If a roll to remove traps fails<BR>
     by 26% or more, the thief accidentally activates the trap. Time is 1-10<BR>
     rounds for each function. Magic or magically hidden traps are not<BR>
     affected by this skill.<BR>
  4. Moving Silently - this is the ability to move with little or no sound<BR>
     or disturbance across surfaces. It can be attempted whenever the thief<BR>
     moves, but maximum rate of movement is at normal exploratory rate, i.e.<BR>
     no sprinting, etc., while moving silently.<BR>
  5. Hiding in Shadows - this is the ability to blend into dark areas, and<BR>
     to remain motionless when in sight. Hiding in shadows cannot be<BR>
     accomplished under direct observation. It can only be successful with<BR>
     regards to creatures with infravision if a heat source is nearby.<BR>
     Success indicates that the thief is invisible until he moves. Note that<BR>
     a hidden thief is still subject to detection as if invisible.<BR>
<BR>
The secondary functions of a thief are:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Listening at Doors - this includes like activity at portals such as<BR>
     windows, vents, etc.<BR>
  2. Climbing Walls - this is the ability to ascend and descend vertical<BR>
     surfaces. Surface conditions may modify the chance of success.<BR>
  3. Backstabbing - this is the striking of a blow from behind. The target<BR>
     must have a definable `back' for this to work. Damage inflicted is<BR>
     twice normal at levels 1-4, thrice normal at 5-8, quadruple at 9-12,<BR>
     and quintuple at levels 13+.<BR>
<BR>
Additional thief abilities are:<BR>
<BR>
  1. All thieves, regardless of alignment, have their own language,<BR>
     "Thieves' Cant." This language is known in additional to others which<BR>
     may be learned because of intelligence and/or race.<BR>
  2. At 4th level, thieves are able to read 20% of languages, and this<BR>
     ability increases by 5% per level until a maximum 80% at 16th level is<BR>
     attained. It can only be attempted once per level; the thief must gain<BR>
     a level before attempting a new roll. In any case, the thief will<BR>
     understand a portion of the writing equal to the chance to read it, ie.<BR>
     if a 60% chance to read is successful, then about 60% of the contents<BR>
     are understood. Languages which are relatively close to ones known by<BR>
     the thief do not incur this comprehension penalty. Lost or encrypted<BR>
     languages are always unreadable.<BR>
  3. At 10th level, thieves are able to decipher magical writings and<BR>
     utilize scrolls of magical and druidic nature (though not clerical<BR>
     ones). However, since thieves do not fully comprehend the magic means<BR>
     by which scrolls operate, there is a 25% chance that the writings may<BR>
     be misunderstood. Furthermore, there is a 5% chance per level of the<BR>
     spell that it will be mispronounced and an unintended effect will<BR>
     occur.<BR>
<BR>
Thieves begin with the following scores in their abilities:<BR>
<BR>
 Ability          Base Maximum<BR>
 Pick Pockets      15    none<BR>
 Open Locks        10    none<BR>
 Find/Remove Traps  5    none<BR>
 Move Silently     10    100<BR>
 Hide in Shadows    5    100<BR>
 Detect Noise      15     60<BR>
 Climb Walls       60    100<BR>
<BR>
60 additional points are allotted for distribution at 1st level; an<BR>
additional 25 points is gained for every level attained thereafter. These<BR>
points may be distributed as the player sees fit, though no ability may<BR>
exceed the maximum. (This does not include racial and/ or dexterity<BR>
modifiers, which may move the ability beyond the maximum allowable.)<BR>
<BR>
Thieves do not build strongholds like some other classes of characters do.<BR>
They can, however, build a tower or some other fortified building within or<BR>
very close to a city or town.<BR>
<BR>
Any thief of 10th level or greater may use this stronghold to set up a<BR>
headquarters for a gang of thieves, and he or she will accordingly attract<BR>
4-24 other thieves. However, the local Thieves' Guild will take offense at<BR>
this intrusion, and they will struggle to do away with this new<BR>
organization. This warfare will continue until the thief character relocates<BR>
or all Master Thieves in the Guild have fled or been killed.<BR>
