The druid is a subclass of cleric; in effect, they are nature's priests, as<BR>
they are primarily concerned with the protection and welfare of natural<BR>
settings and creatures. Druids are of True Neutral alignment, viewing all<BR>
things as a system of checks and balances in the larger picture of nature. A<BR>
druid must have a minimum of 12 in wisdom and 15 in charisma. Druids with<BR>
both wisdom and charisma of 16 or greater gain a 10% experience bonus. High<BR>
wisdom also grants a druid bonus spells (see Wisdom Table II).<BR>
<BR>
Druids are very much in contact with nature; their spell selection reflects<BR>
this bias. Due to their close link with nature, druids may only wear leather<BR>
or padded armor, and may utilize only wooden shields. However, they have a<BR>
wide variety of weapons at their disposal, along with several special<BR>
abilities. Druids make saving throws as normal clerics, but gain a +2 bonus<BR>
vs. electrical and fire attacks.<BR>
<BR>
Druids are a special type of cleric whose deities are concerned with living<BR>
and natural things. In effect their sphere of influence is nature. Druids<BR>
have their own spell class and do not use those of clerics, though there are<BR>
many spells in common between the two.<BR>
<BR>
In connection with their close relation with nature, druids gain certain<BR>
innate powers as they progress in level.<BR>
<BR>
At the 3rd level, druids gain the following abilities:<BR>
<BR>
   * Identification of plant type.<BR>
   * Identification of animal type.<BR>
   * Identification of pure water.<BR>
   * Power to pass through overgrown areas without leaving a discernable<BR>
     trail at normal movement rate.<BR>
<BR>
At 7th level, the following additional powers are gained:<BR>
<BR>
   * Immunity to charm spells cast by any basically woodland creature, i.e.<BR>
     dryads, nixies, etc.<BR>
   * Ability to change form up to three times per day, actually becoming, in<BR>
     all respects save mind, a reptile, bird or mammal. Each type of<BR>
     creature may be assumed but once per day. The size of the creature can<BR>
     vary from as small as a bullfrog to as large as a black bear (roughly<BR>
     double that of the druid.) Each assumption of a new form removes<BR>
     10--60% of the hit point damage sustained by the druid prior to<BR>
     changing form.<BR>
<BR>
Druids have their own secret language, which is learned in addition to<BR>
others allowed by race, intelligence, etc. Upon becoming a 3rd-level druid,<BR>
and with each level thereafter, a druid gains a language of his choice:<BR>
centaur, dryad, elvish, faun, gnome, green dragon, hill giant, lizardman,<BR>
manticore, nixie, pixie, sprite, treantish, and any other that the DM may<BR>
add to this list. These are also in addition to those a character may learn<BR>
according to intelligence.<BR>
<BR>
When a druid reaches 12th level, construction of magic items, scrolls, and<BR>
potions is possible. Druids are only able to make items which they can<BR>
personally use or are intimately associated with nature. Otherwise, they<BR>
produce magic in a similar manner to clerics.<BR>

  1. Archdruids in the service of the Grand Druid have 3 additional spell<BR>
     levels, which may be cast as 1 3rd-level spell, 3 1st-level spells,<BR>
     etc.<BR>
  2. In addition, the Grand Druid gains 6 spell levels.<BR>
<BR>
At the upper levels there can only be a limited number of druids in a<BR>
particular land. Only 9 Druids (12th level) may exists at one time. Each<BR>
such 12th-level druid is the leader of a body of lesser druids and will have<BR>
an entourage of three of their underlings, i.e. the lowest (in experience)<BR>
Druid (12th level) will have 3 Aspirants (1st level) to serve him or her,<BR>
while the highest (in experience) will have 3 Initiates of the 7th Circle<BR>
(9th level). The 3 Archdruids (13th level) each be will be attended by 6<BR>
Initiates of the 8th Circle (10th level), while the lone Great Druid (14th<BR>
level) will have an entourage of 9 Initiates of the 9th Circle (11th level).<BR>
<BR>
Note that each geographic area has this hierarchy of druids. Above all<BR>
druids is the lone Grand Druid (15th level). The Grand Druid is attended by<BR>
9 druids which owe allegiance to none of the hierarchies under the Grand<BR>
Druid's control. Any druid may journey to see the Grand Druid and petition<BR>
to serve him or her. Three Archdruids outside the normal hierarchy roam the<BR>
world as the Grand Druid's agents.<BR>
<BR>
At such time that a character attains enough experience points to become<BR>
12th level, the corresponding powers are gained only if:<BR>
<BR>
   * There is a vacancy in the hierarchy, i.e. there are less than 9 Druids,<BR>
     OR<BR>
   * The character bests one of the current Druids in single combat. If the<BR>
     combat is not lethal, the loser drops to the exact amount of experience<BR>
     points necessary to place him at the beginning of the next lower level.<BR>
<BR>
This process is repeated for a Druid becoming a Archdruid, and for an<BR>
Archdruid becoming the Great Druid. Succession to Grand Druid is handled<BR>
slightly different. Since the position of Grand Druid is one that only a<BR>
bureaucrat could love, Grand Druids may elect to step down after earning<BR>
only 500,000 experience points. If this occurs, the Grand Druid selects his<BR>
or her successor from the eligible Great Druids. Grand Druids may also be<BR>
challenged to a fight for their post, as normal for other druidic positions.<BR>
<BR>
Upon stepping down from the position of Grand Druid, the druid character<BR>
enters the ranks of the Hierophant druids, giving up all experience points<BR>
save one, and progressing upwards through the ranks of the Hierophants. He<BR>
must relinquish the 6 bonus spell levels, and rather than additional spells,<BR>
gains spell-like powers as he progresses:<BR>
<BR>
At 16th level, these powers are gained:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Immunity to all natural poisons (ingested or insinuated animal or<BR>
     vegetable poisons, including "monster" poisons but not mineral poisons<BR>
     or poison gas),<BR>
  2. Extra longevity, equal to level expressed in decades, i.e. 17th level =<BR>
     170 extra years,<BR>
  3. Vigorous health, equal to being in the prime of life, and<BR>
  4. The ability to alter appearance at will. This is accomplished in 1<BR>
     segment, with height/weight increase/decrease by up to 50%, apparent<BR>
     age from child to extreme old age, and body and facial features of any<BR>
     humanoid race. This alteration is non-magical, and cannot be detected<BR>
     short of trueseeing.<BR>
<BR>
At 17th level, druids gain the following abilities:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Hibernation, the ability to enter a state of suspended animation for a<BR>
     period equal to the current level in decades,<BR>
  2. Enter the Elemental Plane of Earth (1 round time), and<BR>
  3. Conjure water elemental once per day.<BR>
<BR>
At 18th level, druids may:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Enter the Elemental Plane of Fire, and<BR>
  2. Conjure air elemental once per day.<BR>
<BR>
At 19th level, druids may:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Enter the Elemental Plane of Water, and<BR>
  2. Conjure magma/smoke para-elemental once per day.<BR>
<BR>
At 20th level, druids may:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Enter the Elemental Plane of Air, and<BR>
  2. Conjure ice/ooze para-elemental once per day.<BR>
<BR>
At 21st level, the character gains the ability to enter any of the<BR>
Para-Elemental planes at will.<BR>
<BR>
At 22nd level, the ability to enter the Plane of Shadow is gained.<BR>
<BR>
At 23rd level, the druid may:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Enter any of the Inner Planes at will,<BR>
  2. Roam the Plane Probability Lines (the 7th dimension), and<BR>
  3. Dwell on the Plane of Concordant Opposition.<BR>
<BR>
The ability to enter a plane also confer the ability to survive there.<BR>
Consider the environment as natural to the character. There is no time limit<BR>
for remaining on such a plane.<BR>
<BR>
Refer to conjure fire elemental in the PH for more details on casting time,<BR>
duration, etc. Use the following table to determine the outcome of any<BR>
actual casting, however. Use the character's level as a percentage chance to<BR>
conjure a specific type. For example, a Numinous Hierophant (20th level) has<BR>
a 20% chance of being able to conjure a desired creature. If the dice roll<BR>
in such a case is 21 or higher, ignore the desired result and determine the<BR>
creature(s) conjure from the appropriate table below. Note that the chance<BR>
to override the dice roll only applies to druids of 16th level or higher.<BR>

<BR>
Individuals conjured (any single-creature result) will have as many extra<BR>
hit points added to their total as the conjurer has level, subject to the<BR>
maximum number of hit points for that ilk. Regardless to alignment and<BR>
temperament, all conjured creatures will obediently and selflessly serve the<BR>
Hierophant.<BR>
<BR>
Druids have their own versions of faith magic and cooperative magic (cf.<BR>
Cleric). Druids also may use Quest spells in a similar manner to clerics,<BR>
but the following restrictions apply: no less than 12th level, minimum<BR>
wisdom and charisma of 17, and the granting of Quest spells always relates<BR>
to something directly affecting the natural world.<BR>
<BR>
Druids do not generally build castles, or for that matter, live in cities or<BR>
towns. They tend to inhabit places of natural beauty, where they will build<BR>
small buildings. Upon reaching 12th level and above, druids will attract the<BR>
followers described above; in addition, druids will often attract groups of<BR>
woodland creatures to their abode.<BR>
