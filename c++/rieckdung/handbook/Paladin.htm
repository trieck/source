   * Paladins gain 3 hit points per level after the 11th.<BR>
   * If qualification for first level required progression through the two<BR>
     0-levels, then hit dice for first level are 3d4+1, but in all other<BR>
     cases 1d10+3 applies. Additional hit points for high constitution are<BR>
     gained at either Horseman or Protector status, then at each additional<BR>
     level above one as normal.<BR>
<BR>
The paladin class is the ultimate expression of the religious warrior. A<BR>
sub-class of cavalier, paladins must conform to all requirements of that<BR>
class, including proper station. Should a prospective paladin not be of the<BR>
proper station, he must pass through the 0-level Horseman and Lancer levels<BR>
of cavalier before being granted full paladin status at 1st level. In<BR>
addition to the required abilities of the cavalier class (cf. Cavalier), a<BR>
paladin must have a minimum of 13 in wisdom and a 17 in charisma. Paladins<BR>
never gain experience point bonuses.<BR>
<BR>
Paladins must be of Lawful Good alignment and remain of that alignment<BR>
throughout their career - any deviation from lawful good immediately reduces<BR>
the paladin to a cavalier, and paladinhood may never be regained.<BR>
<BR>
Paladins fight and save as cavaliers. They may use all magical items<BR>
permitted to cavaliers. Note: they may NOT use clerical spell scrolls.<BR>
<BR>
Paladins have all the abilities and skills of the cavalier class. Paladins<BR>
may increase their charisma scores in a manner similar to that in which they<BR>
increase their strength, dexterity, and constitution scores. In addition,<BR>
they are able to cast clerical spells at higher levels and have a variety of<BR>
special powers unique to paladins:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Detect evil at a range of 60 feet, as often as desired, but only when<BR>
     the paladin is actively concentrating on locating evil and is seeking<BR>
     to detect it in the right general direction.<BR>
  2. Immunity to disease of all forms.<BR>
  3. The ability to "lay hands on", either upon himself or others, and cure<BR>
     wounds; this cures 2 hit points per level of the paladin. This ability<BR>
     functions but once per day.<BR>
  4. Make all saving throws at +2.<BR>
  5. The continual emanation of a circle of protection from evil at a radius<BR>
     of 10 feet from the paladin.<BR>
  6. At 3rd level, the paladin may affect undead as a cleric two levels<BR>
     lower than his current level; i.e. as a 1st-level cleric at 3rd level,<BR>
     a 2nd-level cleric at 4th level, etc.<BR>
  7. At 4th level - or any time thereafter - the paladin may call for his<BR>
     warhorse. The paladins warhorse is a special creature of greater power<BR>
     than a normal horse. But one warhorse is available every 10 years;<BR>
     should a paladin desire a new one (or lose the old one), he must wait<BR>
     until the required amount of time has passed.<BR>
  8. If in possession of a "Holy Sword", a paladin may dispel magic at a<BR>
     level equal to his own with a radius of 10 feet.<BR>
<BR>
Paladins, due to their unique status within their religions, have several<BR>
special strictures which must always be followed:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Retention of monetary wealth is forbidden; all money not immediately<BR>
     needed for the support of the paladin, his henchmen and retainers, and<BR>
     maintenance of a castle must be given to an institution of lawful good<BR>
     of the character's choice.<BR>
  2. An immediate tithe of 10% of all income - be it treasure, wages, or<BR>
     whatever - must be donated to a lawful good institution.<BR>
  3. No more than 10 magic items may be possessed at once. This includes no<BR>
     more than:<BR>
          1 suit of armor<BR>
          1 shield<BR>
          4 weapons, and<BR>
          4 other magic items<BR>
  4. Paladins will have henchmen of lawful good alignment only, and will<BR>
     associate only with characters that are mostly compatible with the<BR>
     goals and beliefs of lawful good.<BR>
<BR>
Upon reaching 9th level, paladins may build a religious stronghold. This<BR>
must contain a temple, et al., of at least 1500 square feet. Paladins do not<BR>
attract a body of men-at-arms as do normal cavaliers, though they do attract<BR>
retainers, all of which are cavaliers, but not necessarily paladins. After<BR>
clearing an area around the temple, the paladin may collect revenues of 8sp<BR>
per inhabitant.<BR>

<BR>

Paladins may gain bonus spells for high wisdom (see Wisdom Table II), but<BR>
may never gain spells higher than 4th level, regardless of wisdom.<BR>
