<BR>
Barbarians are tough, hardy characters from primitive tribes located in the<BR>
more backwards and inhospitable locations of the world. They tend to be<BR>
superstitious, ignorant (at least initially), and stubborn. However, lest<BR>
one laugh at the stupidity or naivete of a barbarian, they are extremely<BR>
powerful and fierce warriors that do not take ridicule lightly! Barbarians<BR>
must have minimum scores of 15 in constitution and strength, 14 in<BR>
dexterity, and a maximum score of 16 in wisdom. Barbarians do not gain<BR>
experience point bonuses.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarians must be of non-lawful alignment, due to the conditions of their<BR>
upbringing. They do not use an alignment language of any sort, and initially<BR>
only know their tribal language and the common tongue. They cannot read or<BR>
write common, though they may be able to in their native language.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarians use the fighter combat table. They are able to use any sort of<BR>
weapon or armor; however, certain types are preferred to others. In place of<BR>
the Dexterity Adjustment to Armor Class, barbarians gain a +2 AC bonus per<BR>
point of dexterity over 14 if they are wearing non- or fairly-bulky armor.<BR>
If they are wearing bulky armor, the bonus is only +1 per point over 14.<BR>
Also, barbarians receive +2 hit points per point of constitution over 14.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarians prefer to use certain weapons over others, at least initially.<BR>
All barbarians must have proficiency in the hand axe, knife, and spear at<BR>
1st level. The DM may impose additional requirements according to the<BR>
background of the barbarian's native homeland. Only after all these weapons<BR>
are learned may the barbarian gain proficiency in others. Barbarians may not<BR>
take weapon specialization.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarians detest magic and those who use it. They will, at low levels of<BR>
experience, refuse to employ any sort of magic items they recognize as such.<BR>
They will often seek to destroy magic items, receiving experience points<BR>
equal to as if they had possessed them. While magic-users will be shunned<BR>
initially, and always viewed with suspicion, clerical spells of the type<BR>
used by shamans and witch doctors are not so viewed, though higher-level<BR>
clerical spells are suspect.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarians save as fighters of equal level, but gain certain bonuses: +4 vs.<BR>
poison, +3 vs. paralyzation, petrification, polymorph, and death magic, +2<BR>
vs. rod/staff/wand and breath weapon, and +1 vs. spells for every 4 levels<BR>
attained (+0 initially, +1 at 4th, +2 at 8th, etc.)<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian has various skills which originate from his life in the<BR>
wilderness. Barbarians understand terrain in a manner identical to rangers<BR>
(q.v.). Initially, barbarians have only a home terrain; no other terrain is<BR>
considered familiar. Barbarians may familiarize themselves with new terrain<BR>
as per rangers. Barbarians have the following abilities:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Hide in natural surroundings - this is identical to the ranger ability<BR>
     of hide in terrain (q.v.).<BR>
  2. Barbarians gain a +3 bonus to their chance to surprise an opponent when<BR>
     in home territory; this drops to +2 when in familiar territory, and no<BR>
     bonus when in unfamiliar terrain.<BR>
  3. There is a base 10% chance to surprise a barbarian when in unfamiliar<BR>
     or familiar terrain; this drops to 5% when in home terrain.<BR>
  4. Detect illusion - there is a 5% chance per level that a barbarian can<BR>
     detect an illusion as such. This detection takes one round of<BR>
     concentration. This chance may never exceed 75%.<BR>
  5. Detect magic - there is a 25% chance that barbarians can detect magic<BR>
     of other than an illusion/phantasm type. This takes one round of<BR>
     concentration, and the exact type of magic is never revealed. For each<BR>
     level beyond the first, detection increases by 5%, subject to a maximum<BR>
     of 90%.<BR>
  6. Leadership - when dealing with other barbarians or characters native to<BR>
     the barbarian's home area, the barbarian's level of experience is added<BR>
     to his or her charisma to get an effective charisma score for<BR>
     determination of reactions.<BR>
  7. Survival - as per ranger, except there is a $±$2 penalty to the<BR>
     intelligence check for survival in familiar terrain. As usual, there is<BR>
     no special ability in non-familiar terrain.<BR>
  8. Tracking - as per ranger also, but tracking is accomplishable outdoors<BR>
     only.<BR>
  9. Healing - as per the nonweapon proficiency.<BR>
 10. Outdoorcraft - the barbarian has the equivalents of the nonweapon<BR>
     proficiencies plant lore, animal lore, direction sense, and weather<BR>
     sense. These operate at normal chances when in home terrain, at a +6<BR>
     penalty in familiar terrain, and not at all in unfamiliar terrain.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the barbarian will have one or more secondary abilities,<BR>
depending upon the land of origin of the barbarian (see DM for specifics of<BR>
each area.)<BR>
<BR>
  1. Climb cliffs and trees - this is identical to the thief function climb<BR>
     walls, though it pertains initially only to natural surfaces. A<BR>
     barbarian can learn to climb walls given the opportunity to practice<BR>
     for a few weeks.<BR>
  2. Animal handling - as per the nonweapon proficiency. Initially applies<BR>
     only to specified animals native to the barbarian's homeland, though<BR>
     additional slots may be spent to add other animals.<BR>
  3. Horsemanship - as per the nonweapon proficiency land-based riding. This<BR>
     is in one specified type of animal native to the barbarian's homeland.<BR>
  4. Jumping - as per the nonweapon proficiency.<BR>
  5. Long distance signalling - the ability to use the signalling method of<BR>
     his homeland (drums, smoke, etc.) to communicate over long distances.<BR>
  6. Running - as per the nonweapon proficiency.<BR>
  7. Small craft, paddled - similar to the nonweapon proficiency of boating,<BR>
     this applies only to craft such as canoes, kayaks, etc.<BR>
  8. Small craft, rowed - similar to above, this applies only to craft such<BR>
     as rowboats, barges, etc.<BR>
  9. Snare building - as per the nonweapon proficiency.<BR>
<BR>
Barbarians do not construct castles of the normal sort, and do not gain<BR>
followers as fighters do. However, upon reaching 8th level, a barbarian may<BR>
summon a barbarian horde. This horde can only be summoned in the native<BR>
territory of the barbarian character, from among the natives of his<BR>
background. Cavemen, dervishes, nomads, and tribesmen (See MM) are<BR>
considered barbarians. The barbarian horde can number as many members as its<BR>
leader's experience total divided by 1000. Thus a barbarian that has just<BR>
reached 8th level can summon a 275-man horde, while one that has just<BR>
reached 9th level can summon a 500-man horde.<BR>
<BR>
A horde takes one week to gather in the home territory, and must have a<BR>
stated purpose: "Tear down the College of Magic in Forsmoth brick by brick,"<BR>
etc. Deviation from the stated purpose can cause the horde to disband. At<BR>
any rate, a barbarian horde will only stay together for a number of weeks<BR>
equal to the barbarian's level of experience. At the end of this time, the<BR>
horde will usually disband. Exceptions are: if there is large amounts of<BR>
treasure distributed to the members, if the character has an effective<BR>
charisma of 23 or more, if the leader is a tribal leader as well, or if an<BR>
unattainable goal is within easy reach. Each such exception will lengthen<BR>
the time by no more than 1-2 weeks. Note that a tribal leader that has his<BR>
horde disbanded under him will not receive a warm welcome when he returns<BR>
home.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the normal barbarians gained, there will be shamans and witch<BR>
doctors as appropriate to the number of horde members, and special aides for<BR>
the leader. The leader will have two aides, each of one-half his level of<BR>
experience. Each such aide will have 2 assistants of one-half their level of<BR>
experience.<BR>
