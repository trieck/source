Like the cleric, the sohei is concerned with the worship of a specific<BR>
deity, and the spread of this deity's worship to others. However, the sohei<BR>
is a more active defender of the faith than a normal cleric. They are often<BR>
found guarding temples or churches, or actively seeking out and defeating a<BR>
religion's foes. As they may still be called upon to wield the powerful<BR>
magics that a deity grants, good judgment is also essential. Thus, the<BR>
principle attributes of sohei are wisdom and strength. A sohei must have a<BR>
minimum score of 9 in both wisdom and strength; a good dexterity and<BR>
constitution are also highly desirable. Sohei with both wisdom and strength<BR>
of 16 or greater gain a 10% experience bonus; they also gain bonus spells<BR>
(see Wisdom Table II).<BR>
<BR>
The sohei resembles in many ways several religious orders of knights in the<BR>
medieval ages, and is a common fixture in Oriental settings (each temple<BR>
usually having several dozen protecting sohei). They are permitted to wear<BR>
any sort of armor, and have a much wider selection of weapons than normal<BR>
clerics. As with normal clerics, various religious orders may also have<BR>
preferred and/or forbidden weapons. Sohei have excellent combat progression<BR>
and average saving throw possibilities and also may cast a variety of magic<BR>
spells (although not as many as normal clerics).<BR>
<BR>
Sohei differ from paladins in that they are still ordained priests of their<BR>
religions and are expected to minister to their flocks, although their prime<BR>
duty is protection rather than ministration. As such, they tend to be much<BR>
more tied to a single religous edifice and generally are not explorers or<BR>
wanderers as are paladins and normal clerics. Paladins generally operate<BR>
either alone or in very small groups; several dozen sohei often may be found<BR>
together providing protection for a larger temple or church.<BR>
<BR>
Similar to clerics, sohei often have restrictions on the types of spells<BR>
that they may cast. They may also have restrictions on the exact weaponry<BR>
allowed, although this is less commoon. Additionally, not all religions have<BR>
sohei; particularly non-violent or nomadic religions may find the sohei<BR>
class to be either unnecessary or undesirable; check with the DM for<BR>
restrictions on which religions allow sohei in the campaign world.<BR>
<BR>
Sohei do not have the ability to turn or compel into service undead or<BR>
creatures from the lower planes.<BR>
<BR>
Sohei cast spells as a cleric of identical level; however, they usually have<BR>
a much more limited number of spheres of influence from which to choose<BR>
their spells. Sohei may use faith magic and may participate in cooperative<BR>
magic. On extremely rare occasions, a sohei may be granted a Quest spell.<BR>

Starting at 12th level, construction of magic items, potions, and scrolls is<BR>
possible in a manner identical to clerics.<BR>
<BR>
Sohei must be attached to a particular religous edifice or belong to a<BR>
specific order. Sohei may not generally wander about the countryside without<BR>
a specific purpose specified by superiors at the home church. As a sohei<BR>
rises in level and rank within his religion, more personal discretion is<BR>
allowed when choosing actions, but, in general, a sohei should consider the<BR>
safety of his home church his paramount responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
Sohei of 15th level and above may build a religious stronghold or start<BR>
their own order. Any stronghold must contain a large temple or church of at<BR>
least 5000 sqare feet. Once completed, the stronghold will attact a body of<BR>
worshipers in a manner similar to clerics (q.v.).<BR>
