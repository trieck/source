   * 300,000 experience points per level after the 11th.<BR>
   * Cavaliers gain 3 hit points per level after the 11th.<BR>
   * If qualification for first level required progression through the two<BR>
     0-levels, then hit dice for first level are 3d4+1, but in all other<BR>
     cases 1d10+3 applies. Additional hit points for high constitution are<BR>
     gained at either the first 0th level or 1st level, then at each<BR>
     additional level above one as normal.<BR>
<BR>
The cavalier class is the ultimate product of the upper class<BR>
knighthood---heavily armed and armored in shining plate, sworn to service<BR>
some great cause, deity, noble, etc. Due to the very nature of knighthood,<BR>
cavaliers must be of the proper station; they must be at least a member of<BR>
the upper class should they hope to immediately begin their careers as<BR>
cavaliers. Characters of lower station may become cavaliers by gaining a<BR>
noble or aristocratic sponsor; if they manage to do this, they first must<BR>
progress though two 0-levels of fighter before gaining the full powers of a<BR>
cavalier.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to social standing, a cavalier must have the following ability<BR>
scores: a minimum of 15 in dexterity, constitution, and strength, and a<BR>
minimum of 10 in intelligence and wisdom. Cavaliers never gain an experience<BR>
point bonus for high ability scores.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers are not limited in their choice of weapons, but will prefer to use<BR>
some types over others. In general, cavaliers will shun any weapon<BR>
associated with the lower class or which calls into question the personal<BR>
courage of the cavalier. This includes weapons which deal out damage at a<BR>
distance (polearms, missile weapons, etc.). These weapons may be used at<BR>
normal non-proficiency penalties, but their use may violate the cavalier's<BR>
chivalric code. Cavaliers will seek to master the following weapons before<BR>
taking proficiency in others: lance, long, broad, bastard, and short sword,<BR>
horseman's mace, military pick, and flail, dagger, scimitar, and javelin.<BR>
Elves and half-elves will also prefer the short composite bow.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers may not take weapon specialization (q.v.), but they gain bonuses<BR>
to the use of certain weapons - "weapons of choice" - as they progress in<BR>
levels:<BR>
<BR>
   * At 1st level, the cavalier is +1 to hit with the lance, if used while<BR>
     mounted.<BR>
   * At 3rd level, the cavalier is +1 to hit with either the broad sword,<BR>
     long sword, or scimitar (player's choice).<BR>
   * At 5th level, the cavalier is +1 to hit with either the horseman's<BR>
     mace, horseman's flail, or horseman's military pick (player's choice).<BR>
   * At 7th level, the cavalier is +2 to hit with the lance, if used while<BR>
     mounted.<BR>
   * At 9th level, the cavalier is +2 to hit with either the broad sword,<BR>
     long sword, or scimitar (depending on the choice at 3rd level). At 11th<BR>
     level, the cavalier is +2 to hit with either the horseman's mace,<BR>
     horseman's flail, or horseman's military pick (depending on the choice<BR>
     at 5th level).<BR>
   * At 13th level, the cavalier is +3 to hit with the lance, if used while<BR>
     mounted.<BR>
<BR>
At higher levels, the progression described above increases in a similar<BR>
manner. This to hit bonus does not apply to damage, and does not allow<BR>
cavaliers to hit creatures that can only be hit by magic weapons. Note that<BR>
higher pluses must be taken in weapons chosen at lower levels.<BR>
<BR>
The cavalier may make multiple attacks with a "weapon of choice" as if the<BR>
character were 5 levels higher than actual as far as attacks per round are<BR>
concerned; e.g. a 3rd-level cavalier can attack 3 times every 2 rounds with<BR>
a weapon of choice, as opposed to 1 attack per round with some other<BR>
ordinary weapon. At 16th level and beyond, the cavalier can attack 3 times<BR>
per round with a weapon of choice.<BR>
<BR>
The lance is the preferred weapon of the cavalier, and proficiency with it<BR>
is required at 1st level. The cavalier has a damage bonus equal to the<BR>
character's level when using the lance while mounted. When the cavalier is<BR>
dismounted and using a lance, damage is +1. A heavy lance used while<BR>
dismounted is treated as a awl pike, with respect to all specifications<BR>
except length, weight, and speed factor. A medium or light lance used while<BR>
dismounted is treated as a long or regular spear, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
A cavalier's expertise in weapons allows him or her to parry more<BR>
effectively. Should a cavalier chose to parry rather than attack, all the<BR>
cavalier's to hit bonuses (including those due to strength, magic, and<BR>
weapon of choice) are subtracted from one attacker's die rolls. A parrying<BR>
cavalier may use his shield to parry a second attacker; a shield parry<BR>
reduces the attacker's roll by 1, and a further 1 for each "plus" of the<BR>
shield, if magical. If using a shield parry as well as a weapon parry, any<BR>
further attackers beyond the second ignore the shield bonus when determining<BR>
the cavalier's armor class. If a cavalier performs one or two parries in a<BR>
round, no attacks may be made, even if multiple attacks would normally be<BR>
allowed.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers consider armor as much a badge of station as protection; they will<BR>
always seek to have the finest quality available. This usually means plate<BR>
armor; if it is not available (or not affordable), they will chose from the<BR>
following in order of preference: platemail, banded or splint mail, chain<BR>
mail, scale mail, or ring mail. Leather, padded, studded leather, and<BR>
brigandine armor are the stuff of peasants, and will not be worn. This<BR>
preference applies to magical armor types as well, so splint mail is<BR>
preferable to chain +2.<BR>
<BR>
Mounted combat is the special province of cavaliers. A human cavalier (but<BR>
not an elven or half-elven one) attacks as one level higher when mounted on<BR>
horseback (or other suitable steed). In addition, cavaliers are virtually<BR>
bread into the saddle; they automatically receive the land-based riding<BR>
non-weapon proficiency in horses at 1st level. Every 3 levels thereafter<BR>
(i.e. 4th, 7th, 10th, etc.), the cavalier gains another free riding<BR>
proficiency slot, which may be taken in the character's choice of steeds, or<BR>
used to increase skill in an already known beast. Every 7 levels (i.e. 7th,<BR>
14th, 21st, etc.), the cavalier receives a free airborne riding proficiency<BR>
in the character's choice. Note that in order to receive these free<BR>
proficiencies, the cavalier must find a teacher that has proficiency in the<BR>
desired beast, and probably pay for the training.<BR>
<BR>
A cavalier undergoes continual training and practice in arms, such that any<BR>
part of a day not spent adventuring must be spent in weapons drills. As a<BR>
result of this training, the cavalier can increase his or her strength,<BR>
dexterity, and constitution. When a cavalier is 1st level, percentile dice<BR>
are rolled for each of these abilities, and the result is noted next to the<BR>
main score (in a manner similar to exceptional strength). For each<BR>
additional level gained, 2d10 are rolled for each ability, and the result is<BR>
added to the percentile score. Any result over 100 results in 1 being added<BR>
to the main score, and 100 being subtracted from the percentile score. In<BR>
this manner, a cavalier may increase his strength, dexterity, and<BR>
constitution to a maximum of 18/00. When determining ability scores, the<BR>
percentile is ignored (i.e. 16/89 is treated as a 16) with the exception of<BR>
strength scores over 18/01, which is treated normally as exceptional<BR>
strength.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers make all saving throws as fighters. However, they receive several<BR>
special bonuses. Cavaliers are immune to all forms of fear, and continually<BR>
radiate protection from fear, 10$'$ radius, such that all allied creatures<BR>
are similarly protected. In addition, cavaliers are 90% immune to<BR>
mind-affecting magic, including beguiling, charm, domination, hold,<BR>
hypnosis, magic jar, possession, sleep, suggestion, and the psionic mind<BR>
blast, but not the effects of high comeliness. This resistance is in<BR>
addition to applicable saving throws. Cavaliers save vs. illusions at +2.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers are able to remain conscious at negative hit point levels, the<BR>
exact amount before unconsciousness is equal to the number of hit points<BR>
possessed at 1st level; i.e. 4-13. Once negative hit points are reached, the<BR>
cavalier must stop fighting, dress his wounds and seek aid. Cavaliers heal<BR>
as other characters, but those of good alignment add 1-4 point more per<BR>
week.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers are required to initially be of good alignment. However, alignment<BR>
change may occur up through 4th level without penalty, but any change<BR>
thereafter incurs the usual penalty. Thus there are neutral and evil<BR>
cavaliers. Neutral and evil cavaliers lose the protection from fear aura,<BR>
and cannot function at negative hit points, but retain all other abilities<BR>
of the class. Evil cavaliers may use poison.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers may expect full hospitality - food, lodging, etc. within reason -<BR>
from all other cavaliers of the same alignment. Such hospitality is likewise<BR>
due from all noble and royal houses that are of similar political alignment<BR>
with the cavalier's liege.<BR>
<BR>
All cavaliers are required to serve a cause, deity, noble, or some other<BR>
higher institution. In serving this cause, the cavalier is bound by a strict<BR>
code of conduct, akin to the medieval chivalric code. In brief, this code<BR>
is:<BR>
<BR>
 Noble service cheerfully rendered.<BR>
 Defense of any charge unto death.<BR>
 Courage and enterprise in obedience to rule.<BR>
 Respect for all peers and equals.<BR>
 Honor to those above your station.<BR>
 Obedience and respect from those beneath your station.<BR>
 Scorn for those lowly and ignoble.<BR>
 Military prowess exercised in service of your lord, et al.<BR>
 War is the flowering of chivalry.<BR>
 Battle is the test of courage.<BR>
 Combat is glory.<BR>
 Personal glory above all in battle.<BR>
 Death to all who oppose the cause.<BR>
 Death before dishonor.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike other character classes, cavaliers begin to gain followers at lower<BR>
levels. They start to accumulate followers beginning at 4th level. These<BR>
followers will be found only if the character is in an appropriate place.<BR>
See the DM for more details. Cavalier followers serve for nothing more than<BR>
food, lodging, and appropriate rewards.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers may hire any class of character that conform to their standards of<BR>
conduct. Cavaliers may have a number of henchmen as dictated by their<BR>
charisma, +3 if of good alignment, +1 if of neutral or evil alignment.<BR>
<BR>
Cavaliers are required to begin hiring retainers at lower levels. At 4th<BR>
level, a cavalier must take on a 1st- and/or 2nd-level cavalier. At 6th<BR>
level, a 3rd level cavalier must be added. At 7th level, a 0-level Horseman<BR>
and Lancer must be retained. All cavalier retainers serve for nothing more<BR>
than food, lodging, and training, as required.<BR>
