Bards are the musicians and story-tellers of the AD&D© world - they sing and<BR>
play instruments, and are vast storehouses of knowledge and oral tradition.<BR>
They are also jack-of-all-trades, having a smattering of experience and<BR>
skills in a wide variety of areas.<BR>
<BR>
The bard class is a very potent class, partly due to the stiff requirements<BR>
for entry. A bard must have a minimum score of 15 in the following<BR>
abilities: wisdom, dexterity, charisma, and strength. Bards also must have a<BR>
minimum of 12 in intelligence and 10 in constitution. Bards do not gain<BR>
experience point bonuses for their high ability scores.<BR>
<BR>
Bards must always remain neutral, though chaotic, lawful, evil, and good<BR>
variations are allowable.<BR>
<BR>
As a jack-of-all-trades, bards have a wide variety of skills. They possess<BR>
some of the skills of fighters, thieves, and druids, and in addition have<BR>
unique powers.<BR>
<BR>
Bards' hit progession is similar to fighters at low levels, but slows to<BR>
near druidic-level at mid and high levels. Their saving throws are<BR>
excellent, generally being the best of a fighter, druid, or thief of an<BR>
equivalent level.<BR>
<BR>
Bards may specialize in one weapon or fighting style only. They also have<BR>
thieving skills, starting off at 1st level with the following abilities:<BR>
<BR>
 Ability          Base Maximum<BR>
 Pick Pockets      15    none<BR>
 Open Locks        10    none<BR>
 Find/Remove Traps  5    none<BR>
 Move Silently     10    100<BR>
 Hide in Shadows    5    100<BR>
 Detect Noise      15     60<BR>
 Climb Walls       60    100<BR>
<BR>
40 additional points are allotted for distribution at 1st level; an<BR>
additional 15 points is gained for every level attained thereafter. These<BR>
points may be distributed as the player sees fit, though no ability may<BR>
exceed the maximum. (This does not include racial and/ or dexterity<BR>
modifiers, which may move the ability beyond the maximum allowable.)<BR>
<BR>
The ability to read languages is gained at 4th level as normal for thieves<BR>
(q.v.) and likewise has a maximum success rate of 80% at 16th level. The<BR>
ability to use non-druidic scrolls is never gained.<BR>
<BR>
Bards cast druidic spells. They may participate in faith and cooperative<BR>
magic in a manner identical to druids. They may not, however, be granted<BR>
Quest spells.<BR>

   * Bards cast their spells at a druid level equal to their own, but never<BR>
     higher than 12th, until 23rd level is reached. At 23rd level, bards<BR>
     cast their spells at 13th level of ability.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to spellcasting, bards have several other special abilities:<BR>
musical charming and suggestion, additional language fluency, and legendary<BR>
knowledge (see hereafter).<BR>
<BR>
The bard's poetic ability raises the moral of associated creatures within 60<BR>
yards by +2. It can likewise inspire ferocity in attack, so all to hit rolls<BR>
are given a +1 bonus. Both of these effects require 2 rounds of poetics to<BR>
inspire. Note that while occupied with this activity, a bard may engage in<BR>
melee combat but not in singing or spell casting.<BR>
<BR>
A bard's singing and playing negates the song effects of harpies and<BR>
prevents similar attacks which rely on song. It will likewise still the<BR>
noise of shriekers, who are soothed by the vibrations of the bard's<BR>
instrument.<BR>
<BR>
The singing and playing of a bard has a chance to charm most creatures.<BR>
Creatures within 40 yards of the bard and not associated with the bard might<BR>
possibly be affected (see charm percentage on the Bard Abilities Table); any<BR>
that are affected must save vs. magic or be charmed and sit entranced while<BR>
the bard plays. Note that even those not charmed will listen to the bard for<BR>
1 round. Charmed creatures are subject to suggestion (as per the magic-user<BR>
spell) from the bard; should the bard implant a suggestion in his music, the<BR>
charmed creatures must save vs. magic at -2 or be subject to the full effect<BR>
of the suggestion. Those which save are totally free from the bard's<BR>
charming, however. The charming can be attempted but once per day on any<BR>
given creature. Loud noise or physical attack will immediately negate<BR>
charming, but not suggestion.<BR>
<BR>
Due to training, a bard has knowledge of many legendary and magical things<BR>
after 1st level of experience. If some legendary knowledge is appropriate,<BR>
and the dice score indicates that the bard has knowledge in the area, then<BR>
his or her ability delivers information similar to that of the magic-user<BR>
spell legend lore. Without actually touching an item, the bard has a like<BR>
chance of determining its magical properties or alignment. A bard may only<BR>
attempt to determine properties for the following items:<BR>
<BR>
   * armor<BR>
   * swords and miscellaneous weapons<BR>
   * potions, scrolls, and rings<BR>
   * rods, staves, and wands usable by a thief, fighter, or druid*<BR>
   * miscellaneous magic usable by a thief, fighter, or druid*<BR>
<BR>
* unless inscribed with writings, in which case the bard can at least read<BR>
what is written.<BR>
<BR>
Artifacts, relics, and unique items are considered legendary in nature and<BR>
are not considered miscellaneous magic items.<BR>

   * College is an important distinction to a bard, and he or she will not<BR>
     associate with a bard of a lesser college. The exception is Magna<BR>
     Alumnae, who will happily aid any bard of any level.<BR>
   * Additional Languages Known indicates the number of new languages that<BR>
     the bard gains by advancing to this level. These languages are assumed<BR>
     to be learned in training, so no study time is necessary.<BR>
   * Charm Percentage is the chance that the bard has of successfully<BR>
     casting a charm person (or charm monster) spell with his or her music.<BR>
   * Legend Lore / Item Knowledge shows the chance that the bard has of<BR>
     knowing something about a legendary person, place, event, or thing, or<BR>
     knowing what a particular magic item is.<BR>
<BR>
Bards always carry a musical instrument, usually a stringed one.<BR>
<BR>
Bards may use magic items permitted to fighters, thieves, and druids, and<BR>
magical arms and armor of permitted types. Books, Tomes, et al, that affect<BR>
fighters, thieves, or druids also affect bards. If the work is baneful,<BR>
treat the bard as the least favorable of the three classes.<BR>
<BR>
When a bard reaches 13th level, construction of magic items, scrolls, and<BR>
potions is possible, as per clerics and druids. While bards are limited to<BR>
construction of items that they are permitted to use, several rare magic<BR>
items are manufacturable only by bards.<BR>
<BR>
Only bards of 23rd level settle down and build fortresses, and they do not<BR>
attract a mass of followers as clerics or fighters do. Bards may have 1<BR>
henchmen at 5th level, 2 at 8th, 3 at 11th, 4 at 14th, 5 at 17th, 6 at 20th,<BR>
and any number at 23rd, subject to the maximum allowable by the bard's<BR>
charisma.<BR>
