Rangers are nature's woodsmen; at home in the expanse of the outdoors, they<BR>
are able to thrive in conditions other characters find intolerable. In order<BR>
to become a ranger, a character must have a minimum of 13 in strength and<BR>
intelligence, and a minimum of 14 in wisdom and constitution. Should a<BR>
ranger have a strength, intelligence, and wisdom all of 16 or better, he or<BR>
she gains a 10% experience bonus.<BR>
<BR>
Rangers must be of good alignment; whether this is lawful, neutral, or<BR>
chaotic good is irrelevant. However, should a ranger ever change alignment<BR>
to a non-good one, all ranger abilities are lost forever, and the character<BR>
becomes a normal fighter.<BR>
<BR>
The ranger is an outdoorsman par excellence; he is able to find food and<BR>
water, locate game, hide from enemies, and track with accuracy. These<BR>
abilities are linked to the familiarity that a ranger has with the<BR>
surrounding terrain and environment. For the purpose of the following<BR>
determinations, there are three types of terrains and environments: home,<BR>
familiar, and unfamiliar. Home terrain is one that encompasses the ranger's<BR>
base terrain and environment or one in which the ranger has spent at least 1<BR>
year exploring after becoming familiar with it. Familiar terrain is terrain<BR>
similar to home terrain - but differing in some significant way - or<BR>
unfamiliar terrain that the ranger has spent 6 months exploring and learning<BR>
about. Unfamiliar terrain is completely different from home terrain.<BR>
Example: a ranger whose home terrain is a hot, sandy desert (like the<BR>
Sahara) would only be familiar with the hard-packed dryness of a cold desert<BR>
(like the Gobi) since the plant life is considerably different, and would<BR>
consider a temperate forest completely unfamiliar. Note that underground<BR>
environments are usually completely different from other types of terrain,<BR>
and should be considered a separate terrain type. Consult the DM for a full<BR>
list of terrain/environment categories.<BR>
<BR>
Rangers fight and save as fighters. They also may benefit from weapon<BR>
specialization (q.v.). Rangers can use any type of weapon, though those<BR>
types used in a ranger's homeland will be given preference to others. The DM<BR>
will indicate which weapons a particular land favors; a ranger must gain<BR>
proficiency in these types before attempting to learn others. Rangers may<BR>
use all types of armor; however, most prefer the lighter kinds, as exploring<BR>
in heavy armor is wearisome. In addition, rangers have a variety of useful<BR>
abilities, and at high levels may cast druidic spells. The major abilities<BR>
of a ranger are:<BR>
<BR>
  1. When fighting humanoid-type creatures of the ``giant-class'' (see DM<BR>
     for inclusive list), rangers gain a +1 damage bonus for each level of<BR>
     experience.<BR>
  2. Subtract 1 from his chance to be surprised (q.v.).<BR>
  3. At 10th level, the ability to use non-written magic items pertaining to<BR>
     ESP, clairaudience, clairvoyance, and telepathy.<BR>
  4. The ability to track creatures, as per the non-weapon proficiency of<BR>
     the same name. Rangers gain a -1 bonus to their roll for tracking<BR>
     success for every 3 levels attained (i.e. +0 at 1st-3rd level, -1 at<BR>
     4th-6th, -2 at 7th-9th) to a maximum bonus of -6 at 19th level and<BR>
     beyond.<BR>
<BR>
The following abilities function differently in home, familiar, and<BR>
unfamiliar environments:<BR>
<BR>
  1. Surprise - a ranger receives a +1 bonus to his chance to surprise<BR>
     (q.v.) in familiar terrain and +2 bonus when in home terrain.<BR>
  2. Hide in Terrain - When in home terrain, rangers may attempt to<BR>
     camouflage themselves in a manner similar to the thief ability of hide<BR>
     in shadows. Rangers have half the normal chance to hide when in<BR>
     familiar terrain, and cannot successfully hide in unfamiliar terrain.<BR>
  3. Move Silently - rangers may move silently in their home terrain with<BR>
     normal chance for success; when in familiar territory, the chance is<BR>
     halved. There is no chance that a ranger can move silently in<BR>
     unfamiliar terrain.<BR>
  4. Survival - similar to the nonweapon proficiency of survival, this<BR>
     allows the ranger to find food, water, and shelter for himself and a<BR>
     number of additional persons up to his current level; i.e. a 4th-level<BR>
     ranger can provide for himself and up to 4 others. Rangers may<BR>
     automatically find these necessities when in home terrain. They must<BR>
     pass a successful Intelligence Check when in familiar terrain, and do<BR>
     not possess any more knowledge than other characters when in an<BR>
     unfamiliar environment.<BR>
  5. Additional Skill - a ranger has some skill in an ability common in his<BR>
     homeland. This translates as an additional free nonweapon proficiency.<BR>
     The DM will indicate which one according to the homeland of the<BR>
     character. Typical skills are: canoeing (boating), riding, jumping,<BR>
     running, or swimming.<BR>
<BR>
Rangers also must abided by several strictures:<BR>
<BR>
  1. No more than three rangers may ever operate together.<BR>
  2. Only sufficient wealth to cover their costs (personal, henchmen,<BR>
     castle, etc.) may be retained and the rest must be given to a worthy<BR>
     cause or institution in a manner similar to paladins (q.v.).<BR>
  3. Men-at-arms, henchmen, servants, et al., may not be hired until 8th<BR>
     level is reached.<BR>
<BR>
Rangers do not attracted a body of men-at-arms as do normal fighters, but at<BR>
10th level, they do attract a group of 2-24 followers. Rangers may build a<BR>
stronghold and collect revenue, as per fighters (q.v.).<BR>
