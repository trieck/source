OK guys, I was told that if I got serious about this it would inspire you as<BR>
well. here's the plan, I think we should start with all new characters levels<BR>
5-7, and begin module "A3-Assault on the aerie of the slave lords" again<BR>
from the start. (I'm assuming you all remember almost nothing about it).<BR>
When we played it a few years ago, we played modules A1 & A2 before it,<BR>
however I don't think that is necessary. We'll need about 7 or 8 characters,<BR>
which means you'll each be playing two and I'll have one or two NPC's.<BR>
Here's how I see it:<BR>
<BR>
1) Paladin (Jim)<BR>
2) Ranger (David)<BR>
3) Monk (Tom)<BR>
4) Fighter/Cleric (Steve)<BR>
5) Thief (David)<BR>
6) Magic-User or Illusionist (Tom)<BR>
7) Magic-User or Illusionist (Steve)<BR>
8) Healer (Jim)<BR>
<BR>
Each player will need:<BR>
1) Access to internet via irc-2.mit.edu for 2 hours each sunday.<BR>
2) Set of dice.<BR>
3) Old (first edition) players hand book. (not absolutely necessary, but I found<BR>
some for sale on the net for about $5).<BR>
4) Pencil and paper<BR>
<BR>
One of the best things about playing on the net is that we will have a text<BR>
transcript of every action throughout the entire campaign. We will need to<BR>
be patient as this will become easier as we become more familiar with it, also<BR>
Tom, do you have access to a scanner at work? if not I can scan maps and<BR>
other things at Kinkos down the street. Of course, this is all open for<BR>
discussion and if you want to play a different class, let me know. Please fill<BR>
out (as much as you can) and return the following character sheet for each of<BR>
your characters by email. I will review them and make any<BR>
completions/edits that are necessary and then return them to you. Please<BR>
keep most character information confidential between each player and the<BR>
DM. Magic Items and money for each character will be rolled randomly by<BR>
me. As 5th to 7th level characters, You can have any normal non-magical<BR>
Items you can carry.<BR>
