<TR><TD>no</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>DJRCK (22:26:02) ok</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>the nature of this module may or maynot allow for such things</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>tommyboy (22:26:25) the internet is dead communication is amazing right now</TD><TR>

<TR><TD>tommyboy (22:27:02) Well, Dave what do you make of the map any choice of</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>whats behind cutains 1- 4</TD><TR>

<TR><TD>the net is dead</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>DJRCK (22:27:26) we need to know more, check for traps, etc</TD><TR>

<TR><TD>nothing out of the ordinary the tunnels are only visible up close,</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>in fact they are sort of concealed by shrubberies...nee</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>tommyboy (22:30:00) Holy grail?</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>DJRCK (22:30:10) we should need to look through and around the shrubs</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>but first check for traps</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>DJRCK (22:30:25) of course we need to develop characters</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>dave likes to check for traps, a good policy</TD><TR>
<TR><TD>DJRCK (22:30:52) we should email you the detail in time to start sunday</TD><TR>
