The party is standing on the rocky slope of a steep hill as the sun is setting <BR>
on the horizon. Your horses have been tied under some nearby trees, and <BR>
the party is deciding which of the four entrances to investigate. No clear <BR>
tracks at any of the entrances can be made out. The caves are all very dark, <BR>
and the party will need light sources as soon upon entering.<BR>
