<H1>MODULE A3 - Assault on the aerie of the slave lords</H1>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva">
Background:<BR>
<BR>
For several years, organized bands of marauders and slavers have made a<BR>
living raiding the coastal towns of the sea of gearnat. Ranging from Onnwal<BR>
to the wild coast, they have descended quickly and ruthlessly upon the small<BR>
towns and villages, and carried off citizens into the night. Though these<BR>
marauders were not approved of by the lords and rulers of the lands they<BR>
raided, they were allowed to continue thier depradations. Feuding amongst<BR>
the lords and lack of funds prevented all but an occasional naval battle with<BR>
the villians and the slow fortification of the towns. Bribery was often a more<BR>
effective method of protecting one's lands from the incursions of these<BR>
avericious sea wolves.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, however, the slavers attacks have become more frequent and<BR>
viscious. Believing thier prey to be weak and helpless, the raiders have<BR>
burnt entire villages and pulled down the walls of towns. Women, children<BR>
and whole families have disappeared; and though the bribes are accepted the<BR>
agreements are ignored. Vast tracts of coastline have been reduced to ashes,<BR>
left barren except for packs of wild dogs.<BR>
<BR>
The lords have finally become determined to take action, forgetting their<BR>
petty squabbles to unite against the marauders of the yellow sails. Through<BR>
information gained from escaped slaves and those fortunate to have been<BR>
found and bought by family and friends, the lords have traced the slavers to<BR>
the land from which they launch thier swift attacks on the coast. A plan of<BR>
stealth has been chosen - several small bands of adventurers to attempt<BR>
what couldn't be done by the combined armies of the lords - To infiltrate the<BR>
slavers, and destroy them from within.<BR>
<BR>
You are one of those parties who have entered the no man's land that is the<BR>
Pomarj in the attempt to track the slavers to thier lair. In the course of your<BR>
adventures, you recieved information that the next bastion of the slavers<BR>
was in the Drachensgrab mountains. After many fruitless attempts at<BR>
following parties of slaves and slavers, you discovered that they disappear<BR>
beneath one great peak in the Drachensgrab hills. The search has taken<BR>
many days of winding through cave and tunnel, seeking the pathway that<BR>
the slavers use. At last , the choice has been narrowed down to four tunnels.<BR>
One of these must lead to the aerie of the slave lords!<BR>
